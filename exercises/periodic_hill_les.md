# Flow over periodic hills - LES

In this exercise, we revisit the flow over periodic hills, which we attempted to compute with a direct numerical approach in one of the previous exercises. The present exercise consists of two parts. In part I, we employ a wall-resolving LES, whereas in part II, we introduce wall functions to set up a wall-modeled LES.

## Part I: wall-resolving LES

We use the same setup as in [this exercise](periodic_hills_dns.md) as a starting point for the LES. The following steps guide the process:

- make a copy of the test case *test_cases/periodic_hills_base* in the run folder and navigate to the copy
- set the *simulationType* to LES and add the dictionary below to specify the subgrid-scale model; a suitable value for the constant *Cw* can be found in the article by [Fr√∂hlich et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112004002812), subsection *Subgrid-scale modeling*; a copy of the article is available on StudIP

```
LES
{
    LESModel        WALE;
    turbulence      on;
    printCoeffs     on;
    delta           cubeRootVol;
    WALECoeffs
    {
        Cw          ???;
    }
}
```

- create a new file in *0.orig* named *nut* for the eddy viscosity, e.g., by creating a copy of *p*; adjust the object name and the dimensions; set a uniform fixed value of zero as boundary condition for the walls
- in the *controlDict*, add function objects to compute $y^+$ and $k$; moreover, add the resolutionIndex function object to assess how well the mesh resolves the turbulent spectrum (see below and [here](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/merge_requests/569)); for improved visualization, it is helpful to also compute the temporal mean of the *PopeIndexField*; you may also try an alternative resolution index like the *CelikNuIndex*

```
resolutionIndex1
{
    // Mandatory entries
    type            resolutionIndex;
    libs            (fieldFunctionObjects);
    model           PopeIndex;
    result          PopeIndexField;
    // Optional entries
    U               U;
    UMean           UMean;
    k               "turbulenceProperties:k";
    delta           delta;
    includeKnum     true;
    Cn              1.0;
    log             true;
    timeStart       1.0;
    executeControl  timeStep;
    executeInterval 1;
    writeControl    writeTime;
    writeInterval   -1;
}
```

Now we a ready to run the simulation. Once the simulation is complete, evaluate the following quantities:

- compare the mean velocity profiles to that of the DNS and the reference data
- evaluate the resolution index in ParaView
- evaluate the near-wall resolution in terms of $y^+$ and $x^+/z^+$; for the streamwise and depth components, you can assume that $\Delta x^+ = \Delta z^+ = \sqrt{A}_f y^+/y_1$ ($A_f$ - face area of wall face, $y_1$ - distance of first cell center to the wall); the distance of the first cell center may be estimated by selecting and extracting a cell adjacent to the wall; the face area at the wall can be computed by selecting only the wall patch(es) and employing the *CellSize* filter; finally, the *Calculator* enables converting $y^+$ to $x^+$

## Part II: wall-modeled LES
