Decay of homogeneous incompressible isotropic turbulence

This case is based on the set-up of Comte-Bellot and S. Corrsin [1]

The mesh comprises a block-structured cube divided into 64x64x64 cells, with
a box length of 9*pi cm.

Turbulence is initialised using the target energy spectrum supplied in [1] (see
table 3).
